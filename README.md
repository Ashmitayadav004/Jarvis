# Jarvis
🚀 Project Update | Python Voice Assistant (Jarvis)
Excited to share my latest Python project — Jarvis: A Voice-Controlled Virtual Assistant 🤖🎙️
This project helped me understand how real-time voice systems work, from speech recognition to text-to-speech and command processing.
🔹 Jarvis listens for a wake word, understands spoken commands, and performs actions like opening websites, playing music, fetching news, and more — all using Python.
🔹 Building this project strengthened my skills in Python, API integration, and system automation, while also teaching me how to debug real-world dependency and environment issues.

📌 Key Learnings:
Working with microphones and speech input
Handling APIs and web automation
Managing Python packages and environment compatibility
Looking forward to improving this further by adding AI-based conversational responses and smarter command handling.
